# Using-DearImGui

This project is an attempt to use DearImGui, a C++ GUI library that uses OpenGL to render 2D and 3D graphics.
The goal is to eventually integrate ImGui in a GUI application whereby ImGui will provide the necessary buttons for a user to control the application.
There are three main parts to this project:

- Using vcpkg, which is a C++ packet manager.
- Using CMake, a tool that allows one to create an executable file for different platforms.
- Using ImGui by setting up a basic window with various sample buttons and sliders.
